## Pre-Commit Checks

- [ ] No secrets in code (`git diff --cached | grep -i "password\|secret\|api_key\|token"`)
- [ ] `.gitignore` covers: `.env`, `.env.local`, `*.pem`, `*.key`
- [ ] `.env.example` uses placeholder values (not real secrets)

## Authentication

- [ ] Passwords hashed with bcrypt (≥12 rounds), scrypt, or argon2
- [ ] Session cookies: `httpOnly`, `secure`, `sameSite: 'lax'`
- [ ] Session expiration configured (reasonable max-age)
- [ ] Rate limiting on login endpoint (≤10 attempts per 15 minutes)
- [ ] Password reset tokens: time-limited (≤1 hour), single-use
- [ ] Account lockout after repeated failures (optional, with notification)
- [ ] MFA supported for sensitive operations (optional but recommended)

## Authorization

- [ ] Every protected endpoint checks authentication
- [ ] Every resource access checks ownership/role (prevents IDOR)
- [ ] Admin endpoints require admin role verification
- [ ] API keys scoped to minimum necessary permissions
- [ ] JWT tokens validated (signature, expiration, issuer)

## Input Validation

- [ ] All user input validated at system boundaries (API routes, form handlers)
- [ ] Validation uses allowlists (not denylists)
- [ ] String lengths constrained (min/max)
- [ ] Numeric ranges validated
- [ ] Email, URL, and date formats validated with proper libraries
- [ ] File uploads: type restricted, size limited, content verified
- [ ] SQL queries parameterized (no string concatenation)
- [ ] HTML output encoded (use framework auto-escaping)
- [ ] URLs validated before redirect (prevent open redirect)

## Security Headers

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 0  (disabled, rely on CSP)
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```

## CORS Configuration

```typescript
// Restrictive (recommended)
cors({
  origin: ['https://yourdomain.com', 'https://app.yourdomain.com'],
  credentials: true,
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
})

// NEVER use in production:
cors({ origin: '*' })  // Allows any origin
```

## Data Protection

- [ ] Sensitive fields excluded from API responses (`passwordHash`, `resetToken`, etc.)
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged (passwords, tokens, full CC numbers)
- [ ] PII encrypted at rest (if required by regulation)
- [ ] HTTPS for all external communication
- [ ] Database backups encrypted

## Dependency Security

First locate the **installation boundary**. If the package is matched by a parent `workspaces` declaration, use that workspace root; otherwise use the nearest project root that owns both its manifest and dependency graph. At that boundary, corroborate `packageManager` (when present), the lockfile, and CI commands. Stop if they disagree or competing manager lockfiles exist there. A nested project is independent only when it is outside the parent workspace; independent subprojects may legitimately use different managers.

| Manager/version signal | Frozen/immutable CI install | Known-advisory audit |
|---|---|---|
| npm (`package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json`) | `npm ci` | `npm audit` |
| pnpm | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | `pnpm audit` |
| Yarn 2+ | `yarn install --immutable` | `yarn npm audit -A -R` |
| Yarn 1 | `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` | `yarn audit` |

For an unlisted manager or version, consult its official documentation; do not substitute another manager's commands or newer defaults.

### Install-Script Gate

Never discover dependency lifecycle scripts by first executing an ordinary install on a client whose defaults have not been verified.

1. Bootstrap with dependency scripts disabled, or with a documented default-deny policy plus fail-closed enforcement.
2. Inspect the exact script source and package version before approval.
3. Record the narrowest native allow/deny policy at the installation boundary and commit it.
4. Run a clean frozen/immutable install with that policy and verify the required packages still build.

**Point-in-time snapshot:** Package-manager defaults and command names change quickly. Verify this matrix against the pinned client's current official documentation before relying on it.

| Manager version | Native policy |
|---|---|
| npm without verified granular approvals | Bootstrap with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, or persist `ignore-scripts=true` when project-wide blocking is intended. Keep scripts disabled or deliberately upgrade before allowing any reviewed dependency script. |
| npm 11.18.x (verified on 11.18.0) | Unreviewed dependency scripts run with a warning by default. Enforce `strict-allow-scripts=true` before a normal install, then use the workspace-unaware `npm install-scripts ls` from the installation boundary; keep approvals version-pinned and denials name-wide. |
| npm 12.x (verified on 12.0.1) | Unreviewed dependency scripts are skipped by default; `strict-allow-scripts=true` makes their presence fail the install before execution. Use the same `npm install-scripts` review and approval flow. |
| pnpm 11+ | Use `pnpm approve-builds` and commit `allowBuilds` decisions; `strictDepBuilds` defaults to `true`, so unreviewed builds fail. |
| pnpm 10.26–10.x | Configure `allowBuilds` explicitly, or use `pnpm approve-builds` with the legacy `onlyBuiltDependencies` / `ignoredBuiltDependencies` lists. Set `strictDepBuilds: true`; its v10 default is `false`. |
| pnpm 10.1–10.25 | `pnpm approve-builds` records the legacy lists; enable `strictDepBuilds` where supported (10.3+). |
| Older or unknown pnpm | Bootstrap with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts`. Keep scripts disabled unless the pinned version documents an enforceable policy. |
| Yarn 4.14+ | Dependency postinstalls are disabled by default. Grant only required exceptions with top-level `dependenciesMeta.<package>.built: true`. |
| Yarn 2–4.13 | Set `enableScripts: false` in `.yarnrc.yml`, then grant only required exceptions with top-level `dependenciesMeta.<package>.built: true`; do not enable scripts globally. |
| Yarn 1 | Bootstrap with `yarn install --ignore-scripts`; keep scripts disabled unless each required exception is reviewed under the pinned client's documented workflow. |

### Quick audit commands

```bash
# Audit dependencies (one-shot per manager)
npm audit                       # or: pnpm audit / yarn audit
npm audit --audit-level=critical

# NEVER apply forced fixes without review
# npm audit fix --force          # ❌ may cross declared dependency ranges

# Verify registry signatures where supported
npm audit signatures            # or: pnpm audit signatures

# Upgrade deliberately (not in bulk) — see security-and-hardening skill
npx npm-check-updates
```

## Error Handling

```typescript
// Production: generic error, no internals
res.status(500).json({
  error: { code: 'INTERNAL_ERROR', message: 'Something went wrong' }
});

// NEVER in production:
res.status(500).json({
  error: err.message,
  stack: err.stack,         // Exposes internals
  query: err.sql,           // Exposes database details
});
```

## OWASP Top 10 Quick Reference

| # | Vulnerability | Prevention |

| 3 | Injection | Parameterized queries, input validation |
| 4 | Insecure Design | Threat modeling, spec-driven development |
| 5 | Security Misconfiguration | Security headers, minimal permissions, audit deps |
| 6 | Vulnerable Components | `npm audit`, keep deps updated, minimal deps |
| 7 | Auth Failures | Strong passwords, rate limiting, session management |
